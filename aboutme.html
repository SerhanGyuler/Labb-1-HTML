                            <span>Hi! My name is Serhan Gyuler, and I'm 20 years old. In my free time, I enjoy spending
                                time with my friends, family, and my girlfriend Wilma. I have a strong passion for
                                technology, fitness, and fashion, which reflects my interest in both innovation and
                                creativity.</span>
